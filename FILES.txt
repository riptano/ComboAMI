This describes what all the files in this repository do and how they
are installed on the AMI.  You only need to care about this if you're
going to hack on the AMI configuration scripts.


## .presetup/pre_1.sh

There is no need to execute this file, this just shows what was
installed and in what order.  This file is the precursor for .run.sh
since it installs git and pulls down the scripts for everything else.


## .presetup/pre_2.sh
There is no need to execute this file, this just shows what was
installed and in what order.  To sum up the actions: sun-java6-sdk,
libjna, and DSE/C were installed, the init.d script was written to
disk, the git repository holding this code was cloned, and the
history was cleaned before cloning the machine.


## ds0_updater.py
Updates the AMI scripts before continuing.


## ds1_launcher.py
Actually starts all the AMI scripts from this point.


## ds2_configure.py
This file shows how information about the system is pulled from EC2
and delivered to the reflector and the information it gets back
pointing to the seed list. cassandra.yaml, cassandra-env.sh, and
opscenterd.conf are edited in precise places as well before Cassandra
is launched through the init.d script.


## ds3_after_init.py
Starts OpsCenter after the Cassandra cluster has been initialized.
Also in charge of sending email reports about the cluster's startup
status.


## ds4_motd.py
Holds the command prompt from booting until DSE/C is
initiated. Once DSE/C is up, a quick summary of the nodes is
displayed using 'nodetool ring'. A quick summary of commands is then
printed on the screen for new users.


## reflector.php
The reflector is used to keep track of which IPs are in the cluster
of DSE/C that is being initiated. The reflector receives the internal
IP address, the public dns, the reservation id, and the clustername
to keep track of the clusters' seeds. This data is saved to a SQLite
database. If another request to the php file is sent after 5 minutes
of inactivity, the database is cleared and started fresh to keep the
list of IPs as fresh as possible to avoid conflicts and keep your
privacy.

There is no reason to use your own reflector since your list of IPs
only remains on our server for a lifetime of roughly 5 minutes after
your cluster has finished spinning up. However, reflector.php is
included for use in-house for an even more anonymous setup.


## FILES.txt
This file which gives a file description for each of the scripts.


## SWITCHES.txt
A file explaining all AMI options.


## conf.py
The AMI file that holds all AMI attributes.


## logger.py
The AMI process logging tool.


## tokentool.py
Needed for token calculations.


## ami.log
This is a dynamic file that is created during every boot of the
node. It gives quick printouts to show some parameters that were
chosen during execution and any errors during the startup process.
